# Family Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains code and tools developed for the paper Discovering predisposing genes for hereditary breast cancer using deep learning (https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/4/bbae346/7717952).

# Overview

The FamAnalysis pipeline processes large datasets of missense variants and ranks them based on their pathogenicity compared to other variants in the dataset.
We provide here a user friendly command line interface of the DSRank methodology outlined in our [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/4/bbae346/7717952).
